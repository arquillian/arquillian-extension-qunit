# Arquillian QUnit
The [Arquillian QUnit](https://github.com/tolis-e/arquillian-qunit) is an [Arquillian](http://arquillian.org/) extension which automates the QUnit JavaScript testing on Web Applications. [Arquillian](http://arquillian.org/) integrates transparently with the testing framework which is JUnit in this case and produces a results report. In case of test failures it indicates the specific QUnit JavaScript Test File and the specific line/s in which the error/s occurred.
